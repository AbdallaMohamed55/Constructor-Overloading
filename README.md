# Constructor-Overloading
To study and implement Constructor Overloading

# Aim 

To study and implement Constructor Overloading in C++, using different types of constructors (default, parameterized, and copy constructor) to demonstrate how objects can be created in multiple ways.

# Theory

A constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically invoked when an object is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the data members of a class. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

In Constructor Overloading, multiple constructors are defined within the same class, each with different parameter lists. The compiler distinguishes between them based on the number and types of arguments passed when an object is created.

Types of Constructors in C++:

 1.Default Constructor → Takes no arguments and initializes data with default values.

 2.Parameterized Constructor → Takes arguments to assign user-defined values to data members.

 3.Copy Constructor → Initializes a new object by copying values from an existing object.


 # Procedure 

1. Define a class with required data members (e.g., name, age, length, width, etc.).

2. Write different types of constructors inside the class:

   * Default Constructor to assign initial values.

   * Parameterized Constructor to assign values passed by the user.

   * Copy Constructor to copy values from another object.

 3. Create multiple objects of the class using different constructors.

 4. Compile and run the program.

 5. Observe how different constructors are invoked depending on the arguments given while creating the objects.


# Conclusion 

We successfully implemented Constructor Overloading in C++. By defining multiple constructors (default, parameterized, and copy), we demonstrated how objects can be initialized in different ways. This enhances flexibility, code reusability, and readability in object-oriented programming.
